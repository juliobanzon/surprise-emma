  welcomeQuote: `Welcome!
If you're seeing this website, it means you have eyes. It also means you are very special to Emma, and she would love for you to come by unannounced to scream at her face inside the beloved safe space that she calls home.

Emma obviously really loves being around you so please surprise her with a myocardial infarction (in a good way).

Her real birthday is on December 2, 2026, but I am planning this party on November 21, 2026 as to not raise suspicion.

I thank you in advance for showing up because it would really mean so much to her!

And if you really can't make it, please feel free to still leave a written message or video message for her down below.

Thanks and I look forward to hanging with you all!`,
